A supportive component of the microservices-based Inventory Management System that listens for key application 
eventsâ€”such as successful order placements or low inventory alertsâ€”and delivers notifications to end-users or 
administrators. While actual delivery mechanisms like email or SMS are simulated through console log output, 
the service is designed to be easily extended for real-world messaging integrations. It improves user awareness and 
system transparency by ensuring timely alerts for critical operations.
